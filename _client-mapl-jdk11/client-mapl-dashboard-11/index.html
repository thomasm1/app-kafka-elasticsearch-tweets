Managing Images Exercise

docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
(NOTE: the ":latest" tag is optional because if no tag is supplied the "latest" tag is assumed.)
Next, download the “Apache” image. This image is actually called “httpd.” You can determine the
name of the image by searching for on the command line with "docker search TERM" or by
searching on https://hub.docker.com.
Download the "2-alpine" version of this image instead of the default “latest” image:
docker pull httpd:2-alpine
This image contains Apache version 2, running on the Alpine Linux distribution as its base. Because
of its small size, Alpine is heavily used in containers.
If that tag becomes outdated and doesn’t work for you then visit this page on Docker Hub to get a
working tag:
https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd?tab=tags
Check the images are present
Let’s list the two images that we downloaded:
docker images
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
Check to see how much disk space all of images combined are using.
docker system df
Delete the Images
Now delete each of the two images.
To delete Jenkins use this command:
docker rmi jenkins/jenkins
Note there’s no tag because we have the “latest” tag of Jenkins.
For Apache we have to declare the tag explicitly or the “rmi” command won’t work.
docker rmi httpd:2-alpine
Check That the Images Are Deleted
Make sure the images aren’t present with this command:
docker images

Running Containers Exercise
Goal:
To familiarize yourself with the various options for the “docker run” command.
Instructions:
Start a Container
Start up a container with a simple “docker run” command using the popular key-value database,
Redis:
docker run -dit redis
Check to see if it is running:
docker ps
Look closely at the left-hand side for the container hash under the CONTAINER ID column.
Also look at the arbitrary name that Docker has assigned the container, as you haven’t explicitly
named it. That information is on the right-hand side, under the NAMES column.
Start a Container With a Name
To stop that Redis container, you need to use its hash or arbitrary name.
Start a container with a name we can reference again later:
docker run -dit --name redis_container redis
NOTE: You can also use the "--name=CONTAINER_NAME" syntax.
Check that it’s running:
docker ps
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
Stop a Named Container
Next, stop that container you named:
docker stop redis_container
Check the running containers on the system again:
docker ps
We should only see the one Redis container, which received an arbitrary name from Docker.
Automatically deleting a stopped container
Let’s run a container with the “--rm” option. This option tells Docker to automatically delete the
container once it stops.
We will be using an image called "hello-world", which Docker uses for demonstrations. If you don’t
have a local copy of the image, Docker will download it before starting the container.
docker run --rm hello-world
Check that the image has been deleted after it has completed its execution:
docker ps -a
Now run a container using the hello-world image without the "--rm" option, as shown here:
docker run hello-world
Check that it has not been deleted this time:
docker ps -a
Some users of Docker frequently use the "--rm"option to help with garbage collection.
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
Logs
The “docker logs” command provides information directly from the STDOUT (standard output)
and STDERR (standard error) of a container.
The format of the command is:
docker logs CONTAINER_NAME
Create a container using the “hello-world” image:
docker run --name test_container -d hello-world
Examine the output of the "docker ps" command:
docker ps
Think about the commands you just executed and answer the following questions:
1. Why isn’t the container visibly running with a “docker ps” command?
2. What command will show details of the container?
3. How would you read the output from that container, using the “docker logs” command?
The answer to the first question is because the container already stopped by the time you executed
the "docker ps" command. The hello-world image simply outputs some information and then
stops. Unlike some other containers, it doesn't provide an ongoing service.
The answer to the second question is to use "docker ps -a". That command allows you to view
all containers, including those that are stopped.
docker ps -a
The answer to the third question is to run "docker logs test_container" to see the output
from the container.
Use the name of the container you gave it, “test_container” instead of using the container ID (hash).
docker logs test_container
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
Now display the output of the container with timestamps:
docker logs -t test_container

Managing Docker Volumes - Exercise

Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to create and use volumes with containers.

Instructions:

Create a Volume

Create a volume named "localvolume".

docker volume create localvolume

Use the "docker volume inspect" command to determine where Docker will store the contents
of the volume on your local Docker host's filesystem.

docker volume inspect localvolume

Note the "Mountpoint" path shown as you’ll need it for the next step.

Create a text file named "file.txt" in the volume with the contents of "This file exists".

echo "This file exists" > /var/lib/docker/volumes/localvolume/_data/file.txt

NOTE: Use the output from the above inspect command to determine the path. It will probably be
the same, but there is a slight chance that it may be different on your system.

Run a Container and Attach the Volume to It

Start a detached container using the Apache image named "httpd". Mount the volume named
"localvolume" inside the container at "/data".

docker run -d --name mountvolume --mount src=localvolume,dst=/data httpd

NOTE: The abbreviation of source ("src") and destination ("dst") was used. You could also have
used this for the "--mount" option: "source=localvolume,destination=/data"
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com

Attach to the "mountvolume" container.

docker exec -it mountvolume /bin/bash

Check that the volume is available inside of the container and that the "file.txt" exists.

df -h
cat /data/file.txt

Ensure that the contents of "/data/file.txt" is "This file exists”.

Create a new file on the volume named "from-container.txt" with the contents of "Created from
inside the container".

echo "Created from inside the container" > /data/from-container.txt

Confirm the file was created and that it's contents are as expected:

cat /data/from-container.txt

Detach from the container.

exit

Confirm that you can see the file from the Docker host.

cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/localvolume/_data/from-container.txt

Run a Container with an Ephemeral Volume

Start a container named "tempvolume" in the background. Use the "httpd" image. Also, attach an
ephemeral volume to the container at "/tempdata". You'll need to use type "tmpfs" as the volume
type.

docker run -d --name tempvolume --mount type=tmpfs,dst=/tempdata httpd

Check that the temporary volume is created correctly by inspecting the running container.

http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
docker inspect tempvolume | grep Mounts -A 10

Ensure that the "Type" field shows "tmpfs" and that the "Destination" field shows "/tempdata" as the
path.

Networking Exercise

Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to create a user-defined network for a web application called Drupal.

Instructions:
Create a Network for the Drupal Web Application

Create a Docker bridged network named "drupal".

docker network create drupal

Create a Database Container.

First, create a volume that will be used to store the database data. Name the volume "db".

docker volume create db

Next, start a container named "db" based on the "postgres" image with a tag of "11.5". Make sure it
is connected to the "drupal" network. Also, mount the "db" volume to "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
inside the container.

Create a database named "drupal" that can be accessed by a "drupal" user with a password of
"pw123". To do that, set the following environment variables when starting the container:

POSTGRES_USER=drupal

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pw123

POSTGRES_DB=drupal

(NOTE: The environment variables were determined by looking at the documentation for this image
as found on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)



 
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
Here is the command: (NOTE: Type this all on one line as this is a single command.)

docker run -d --network drupal --name db -e POSTGRES_DB=drupal
-e POSTGRES_USER=drupal -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pw123
--mount src=db,dst=/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:11.5

Inspect the "drupal" network to make sure the container is attached to it. You should see the "db"
container listed in the "Containers" section of the output.

docker network inspect drupal

Create a Drupal Application Container

Start a container named "drupal" based on the "drupal" image with a tag of "8.7.7". Make sure it is
connected to the "drupal" network. Also, publish port 80 on the host and map it to port 80 in the
container.

docker run -d --network drupal --name drupal -p 80:80 drupal:8.7.7

Inspect the "drupal" network to make sure the container is attached to it. You should see the
"drupal" container listed in the "Containers" section of the output.

docker network inspect drupal

Connect the Application to the Database

If you are running Docker on your local machine, then open up a web browser on your local machine
and enter "http://localhost" into your web browser.

However, if the Docker host machine is a remote machine and you want to connect to from another
system, then you'll need the IP address of your docker host machine. Determine the IP address of
your Docker host machine and enter that into your web browser.

One way to get the IP address of your Docker host system is to use the "ip a" command:

ip a

(NOTE: If "ip a" doesn't work, try using the "ifconfig" command.)

http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com

Answer the installation prompts as follows.

Choose Language: English
Choose Profile: Standard
Set up Database:
Select "PostgreSQL"
Database name: drupal
Database username: drupal
Database password: pw123
Click "Advanced Options."
Host: db
Port number: 5432
It should look like this:



Click "Save and continue".

http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com

Configure Site:
Site name: Test
Site email address: root@localhost.localdomain
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Confirm Password: admin123
Click "Save and continue".

You will now be presented with Drupal web application.

Deploying a Private Docker Registry - Exercise

Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to deploy a private Docker registry. Additionally, you will learn how to
pull and push images to the registry you create.

Instructions:
Create and Start a Registry Container

First, create a volume that will be used to store the registry data. Name the volume "registry".

docker volume create registry

Next, start a container named "registry" based on the "registry" image with a tag of "2". Mount the
"registry" volume to "/var/lib/registry" inside the container. Finally, publish port 5000 on the host
and map it to port 5000 in the container.

Here is the command: (NOTE: Type this all on one line as this is a single command.)

docker run -d --name registry --mount src=registry,dst=/var/lib/registry
-p 5000:5000 registry:2

(NOTE: For more information about the official Docker registry image, visit
https://hub.docker.com/_/registry.)

Copy an Image from Docker Hub to Your Registry

Pull down the "nginx:latest" image to your Docker host system.

docker pull nginx:latest

(NOTE: You could also use "docker pull nginx" as the "latest" tag is assumed if no tag is
specified.)

Tag the image as "localhost:5000/nginx:latest". Note that the registry name is "localhost:5000", the
repository is "nginx" and the tag is "latest".

http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com
docker tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest

Check that the image has been tagged.

docker images

You'll notice that the "nginx:latest" image and the "localhost:5000/nginx:latest" images have the
same Image ID.

Push the retagged nginx image into the private registry.

docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest

You can check that the image has been pushed to the private registry using the registry's HTTP API.
(For details on the API, see https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/.)

curl http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog

You should see "nginx" listed as a repository.

{"repositories":["nginx"]}

Remove the Image from the Docker Host

Remove the "nginx:latest" image you downloaded from Docker Hub:

docker rmi nginx:latest

Confirm that the image has been removed with the following command:

docker images

Note that deleting the "nginx:latest" image does not remove the other image with the same Image
ID, which is localhost:5000/nginx:latest. Of course, it also does not remove it from the private
registry.

Next, let's remove the localhost:5000/nginx:latest image.

docker rmi localhost:5000/nginx:latest
http://www.LinuxTrainingAcademy.com

You'll notice that instead of only untagging the image, it also actively deletes the layers that make up
the image.

Confirm that the image has been removed with the following command:

docker images

Even though the image does not exist on our local Docker host machine, it still exists in the registry.

Pull the Image from the Private Docker Registry

To prove that the image is stored in the private registry, pull it from the private registry to your
Docker host system.

docker pull localhost:5000/nginx

You will now see the image listed:

docker images

Start a Container Using the Image

Next, start a container using the image.

docker run -d localhost:5000/nginx
docker ps


OPTIONAL: Access the Private Docker Registry from a Remote Docker Host

First, determine the IP address of your Docker host machine. One way to get the IP address of your
Docker host system is to use the "ip a" command:

ip a

(NOTE: If "ip a" doesn't work, try using the "ifconfig" command.)
