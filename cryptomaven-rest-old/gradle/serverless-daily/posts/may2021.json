         The interesting matter is Ethereum's DeFi applicibility--from real estate to pools and loans--based on sophisticated smart contracts. Bitcoin, aside from form of value, has no parallel attraction.\n<p class=\"quote\"><i>\n \n</p>\n",

Here we have the exponential growth of Ethereum interest, let alone price of token. On the contrary we have Cardano Network, powered by Proof-of-Stake ADA token, which has yet to evolve past TestNet phase, a point of paralysis for Cardano chain DAPP development.

As a number of open source dev ops tools are available to make remote work easier through collaboration, managing developers remains a serious cog in DeFi development. Yet Ethereum and its developer community have thus far been dominant in this sense.<br /><br />\n*In the last three years, Ethereum has widened its developer pool by 215%. Such a network effect would be exceedingly difficult to overcome.</i><sup>2</sup> \n</p></p>\n",
